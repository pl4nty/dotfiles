# dotfiles
Config files for Linux and Windows. 

## Windows
OS config is often manual and difficult to track, so isn't included. Let me know if you have a good way to do this!

For apps, I use the [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) or its corporate variant at work.
[PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is my primary shell, with [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) for terminal multiplexing and [Oh My Posh](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh) for cross-platform theming. [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with ligatures has been my day-to-day font since my first IDE. [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) and [Monaspace](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace) are exciting though.

## Linux
Only accessed remotely (SSH, VSCode Server, dev containers), so just shell config with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [Oh My Posh](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh). Project-specific config is usually managed via dev containers so I can [install my dotfiles automatically](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_personalizing-with-dotfile-repositories).

## Browser
Microsoft Edge with a ton of extensions and userstyles, including some custom ones:
* [ANU CS Dark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pl4nty/dotfiles/master/userstyles/anucs-dark.user.css) (for [cs.anu.edu.au](https://cs.anu.edu.au))
* [Azure Tab Icons](https://github.com/pl4nty/azure-favicons)
